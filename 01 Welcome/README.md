# Welcome
Hi and W+welcome! It is good to see you here at this Windows 10 IoT Core workshop.

In the following modules, you will learn a lot about IoT devices like the Raspberry Pi and how to communicate with and create applications for them. You will get to know Microsoft's IoT offering in the cloud and will manage your devices remotely with Microsoft Azure and you will create a real end-to-end solution that measures data on a Raspberry Pi, sends them to the cloud, processes and visualizes it there and sends data back to the device.

Sounds good? Then let us take a look at what you can expect!
